# Mapbender Development Documentation

Welcome to the Mapbender Development Documentation. This documentation provides in-depth knowledge on how to contribute to (and tinker with) the Mapbender open source code. For starters, check out the [Getting Started Guide](getting_started/introduction.md) and our [Conventions](workflows/conventions.md).

## Contributing

We love contributors! For more information on how you can contribute, please read the [Mapbender Contributing Guide](https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Build Documentation Locally

This is not needed for contributing, but it's useful if you would like to debug some
issue in the docs or if you want to read Mapbender Development Documentation offline.

```console
`$ git clone git@github.com:mapbender/mapbender.git

$ cd mapbender/
$ cd docs/`
```

Browse the files with your favourite IDE to read the docs. It's also possible to search for information this way.
