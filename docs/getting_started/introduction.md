# Introduction

This book is targeted at Mapbender developers and will cover useful topics not needed by administrators or users of Mapbender installations.

## Things to consider

There are a couple of things you should be familiar with in order to contribute to Mapbender:

* **PHP**: We're using PHP which offers full object orientation.
* **Symfony**: This is what we build upon. So read [The Book](https://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html) to learn more about Symfony.
* **JavaScript**: We use jQuery a lot and especially the jQuery UI Widget factory. These are essential to understand and write maintainable JavaScript code.

## Installation

The installation procedure from Git is described in the [Mapbender User Documentation](https://doc.mapbender.org/en/installation/installation_git.html).

## Modules and bundles

Please refer to the respective sections in the [Contributing Guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md) to understand what [modules](/CONTRIBUTING.md#modules) and what [bundles](/CONTRIBUTING.md#bundles) are, and how the latter can be created.

## Twig

Symfony follows the template approach and we use this in Mapbender. Symfony uses a templating engine to generate HTML, CSS or other content. A template is a text file that can generate any text based format like HTML or XML. It is used to express presentational logic. You can use them to create a layout. You can create a base layout and then overwrite or append any of your layout blocks with individual templates.
Read more about Templates in Mapbender at [Templates](/CONTRIBUTING.md#Templates)
or in the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#generate-translations) and find a good introduction about Twig in the [Symfony Template documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/templates.html).
