This is the Mapbender module, the main component of the [Mapbender application](https://mapbender.org).

This module works like a library and can not run on its own. It has to be integrated into [Mapbender-Starter](https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter), which is the starting environment for building Mapbender. The module is loaded via Composer in the [composer.json of Mapbender-Starter](https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter/blob/HEAD/application/composer.json).

This Mapbender module contains most functionality of Mapbender itself. All elements are described in the standalone [User documentation](https://doc.mapbender.org/).

Before building and developing Mapbender on your own, refer to the [Contributing Guide in Mapbender-Starter](https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you want to learn more about the Mapbender development process and the code itself, please read the [Development documentation](https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender/tree/master/docs) that is included in this Mapbender module.

The [Mapbender-user mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/mapbender_users) supports the community in resolving issues and questions regarding installation and operation.

If you want to contribute to the project, you can place issues at [the Mapbender issue page](https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender/issues) on GitHub.

For more information on how to participate, see the [Mapbender website](https://mapbender.org/community/).
